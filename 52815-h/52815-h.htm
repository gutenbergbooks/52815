<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>As the health of a family depends more
upon the quality of their food than upon any
other cause whatever, it is a public benefaction
to give good advice upon this subject.
That this advice may be most widely beneficial,
it should have reference to the material
and the preparation of food; and in both
these respects, regard should be had to economy.
The rich, who are able to provide the
most choice and expensive articles of diet,
frequently fail in having them prepared for
the table in an agreeable and healthful manner;
and the poor, and even those in moderate
circumstances, are not only not generally
well informed as to healthful and nutritious
articles of food, which may be purchased at
moderate expense, but when procured, they
more generally err in the healthful preparation
of them, mistaking high seasoning and
rich mixtures for delicious and wholesome
food. It is to aid the family in procuring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
and preparing their food according to their
means, and with a view to elegance, taste,
and health, that the authoress of this book
has been induced to publish these receipts
and the accompanying advice and reflections.
She does this at the solicitation of many
heads of families, and with the confidence of
knowledge founded on long personal experience.
This is the only source of reliable
knowledge on the subject of procuring and
preparing healthful food, in good taste, and
with elegance and economy.</p>

<p>But proper materials may be obtained for
food, and the cook may understand how to
prepare them; yet she will fail if she does
not have the kitchen furnished with proper
articles for culinary purposes. Each of these
articles should be kept in its proper place,
and scrupulously clean, while every thing
should be done with exactness, and at the
proper time.</p>

<p>The authoress has the greatest confidence
that the circulation of this book will promote
elegance and comfort in wealthy families, and
economy and health in families of moderate
means.

<h3>TO PREPARE AND TO SELECT BEEF, MUTTON,
LAMB, VEAL, AND BACON.</h3>

<p>White meats, such as veal, mutton, and lamb,
should be washed as quickly as possible, or the juices
of the meat will be extracted by the water. Fresh
beef should never be washed, but well scraped with
a clean knife twice over; any soiled parts which
cannot be scraped must be cut off. If the bones
are soiled, saw off the part with the meat saw.
Salted meat should be well washed in three or four
waters, and soaked at least fifteen minutes in cold
water, before putting it down to boil. The pot
should be filled with cold water, and boil slowly till
done, according to the size of the meat, or allow a
quarter of an hour for every pound of the meat;
quick boiling will make the meat hard and insipid.
Be careful that it does not stop boiling, or the meat
will be injured; remove the scum frequently. People
are not generally aware of the injurious effects
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
from eating the flesh of diseased animals. It has
been my practice to choose beef from the whiteness
of the fat, and always object to it if a dark shade
of yellow; let the fat be clear and thick, and the
beef smooth and close; if otherwise, it is old. The
flesh of a young ox should be a good red, and have
a smooth and open grain, and feel tender. Pork
may be judged by the thinness of the skin, and by
pinching the lean; if young, it will break. When
clammy, it is not fit for use. Fresh pork will be always
cool and smooth. The fat of mutton should
be white and firm, and the lean a good colour. If
the vein in the neck of lamb has a greenish cast, it
is stale: it should be of a bluish hue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bacon.</span>&mdash;The lean should be of a good colour,
and tender, and firm on the bone, the fat should be
firm and of a red tinge, and the rind thin. Try a
ham by putting a sharp knife in under the bone. If
the smell is agreeable, the ham is good; if otherwise,
and the knife soiled, reject it. Veal,&mdash;The whitest
is the most juicy, having been made so by frequent
bleeding: the flesh of a bull calf is firmest, but of a
darker colour. Old and diseased meat will shrink
very much in cooking. Hams and tongues, if they
are old and hard, should be put to soak in warm
water the night before they are boiled. A large
ham will take from four to six hours to boil, and a
tongue will take nearly as long. They should be
kept constantly boiling, and well skimmed: put
them down in plenty of cold water. Fish should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
always be boiled in hot water with a little salt in it:
let them boil slowly.</p>

<p>Wild fowls do not require as much cooking as
tame. They should be done before a brisk fire, and
be constantly basted. Wild ducks will cook sufficiently
in a quarter of an hour; pheasants in
twenty minutes. A large turkey will take from
two hours and a half to three hours. Hen turkeys
are the best for boiling. The time will depend
on the size: if a large one, it will take two
hours and a half, and should be boiled in a cloth.
All meats when roasting should be put some distance
from the fire, and brought gradually nearer;
the more they are turned and basted, the more juicy
they will be. Vegetables should be freshly gathered;
they are much sweeter and more healthy, if cooked
as soon as taken out of the ground. When potatoes
are to be fried, throw them in water with plenty of
ice in it after slicing. This will make them crisp.</p>

<h3>BEEF SOUP, THIN.</h3>

<p>Wash and scrape well a shin of beef, put it down
early in the morning in plenty of cold water, with
a piece of veal, and a small piece of lean ham; let
it boil slowly one hour, and skim it well; then add
two carrots, washed, scraped, and cut fine, six
potatoes, four onions, and one turnip; some horse-radish
cut in small pieces; season with black and
cayenne pepper, and salt to your taste: about half
an hour before it is done, put in a bunch of sweet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
herbs, parsley, and a little celery cut in small pieces.
You can either strain it or send it to table with the
vegetables in it.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER BEEF SOUP.</h3>

<p>Boil a shin of beef the day before it is wanted.
The next day put on your stock, after removing the
fat from the top of it; then put in a tea-cup of barley,
wash and cut up two carrots, three onions, one
turnip, three tomatoes, put in parsley and the usual
pot herbs, twenty minutes before it is done; season
with cayenne and black pepper and salt to your
taste.</p>

<h3>VEAL SOUP.</h3>

<p>Put into the soup kettle a small piece of ham; wash
and cut up four onions; put them into the pot with the
ham, and six quarts of water; let it boil slowly an
hour and a half, then put in a shin of veal; let it
boil an hour and a half longer; then take out the
ham; skim off the grease as it rises; beat up in
a gill of good cream, two table-spoonsful of flour,
and the yolks of two eggs very light; and then
add the soup; season with parsley, pepper, and
salt, and serve up.</p>

<h3>MUTTON BROTH.</h3>

<p>Scrape and wash clean a breast of mutton; put
it down in the soup kettle to boil with five quarts of
water, put in a small cup of barley, or two tablespoonsful
of rice; let it boil slowly three hours and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
thirty minutes; skim it well; add carrots, a turnip,
an onion, and a little parsley cut up; let it boil
forty minutes longer; season with pepper and salt;
serve hot. The carrots should be grated.</p>

<h3>CHICKEN BROTH.</h3>

<p>Chicken broth may be made in the same way.
Some persons prefer rice, but rice is used in so
many ways, that barley is more uncommon as well
as more nutritious. Noodles or vermicelli can be
substituted, if preferred.</p>

<h3>CHICKEN SOUP.</h3>

<p>Put a pair of chickens in the soup kettle, with five
quarts of water, one large carrot grated, and let it
boil; skim off the grease as it rises: after it has
boiled three hours take out the chickens, and strain
the liquor through a sieve; put it in the kettle
again; add the vermicelli after it has boiled an
hour, an onion chopped small, some pepper and
salt, a few blades of mace, a little parsley cut fine.
If you like, just before it is served up, add a small
bunch of thyme.</p>

<h3>OYSTER SOUP.</h3>

<p>Strain the liquor from a hundred oysters into the
soup kettle; add a quart of milk, a little mace, cloves,
pepper and salt, with a little rolled cracker; boil
20 minutes; then put in the oysters; stir frequently:
fifteen minutes after the oysters are in, serve it up.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<h3>MOCK TURTLE SOUP.</h3>

<p>Clean very well a calf’s head, take out the eyes,
cut off the nose; let it soak for ten minutes; then
put it down with five quarts of water, a small piece
of ham, four onions, and some salt; let these boil
till tender, or till the meat will leave the bones;
then strain it; add cloves, nutmeg, parsley, and
thyme; let it stew slowly for an hour; add a small
piece of butter rubbed in flour, some wine and
mushroom catsup. You can then put the meat in
or send the soup to table without it, as preferred.</p>

<h3>CALF’S HEAD SOUP.</h3>

<p>Prepare as above. Then put down the head and
liver in six quarts of water; let them boil till tender;
take them up; cut the meat in small pieces;
be careful to take out all the bones; then put the
meat into the liquor with three onions, some cloves,
mace, and nutmeg, pepper, black and cayenne, and
salt; set this on the fire; let it simmer gently an
hour: just before taking it up, add a little butter
rubbed in flour, and some wine.</p>

<h3>OX-TAIL SOUP.</h3>

<p>Wash and joint two ox-tails; pour over them in
a soup kettle five quarts of water; when it comes to a
boil skim it, and add some salt, three onions, two
carrots cut fine, three turnips, four potatoes, a
large bunch of pot herbs, some cayenne pepper,
and a little rice flour; boil slowly for three hours,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
but do not put in the vegetables till after it has
been boiling two hours: half an hour before you
take it up, add a little celery cut up fine.</p>

<h3>MULLAGATAWNY SOUP.</h3>

<p>This soup is always made of the same materials,
only varying in quantity. Brown in some butter
six or eight onions; fry some pieces of rabbits and
chicken; lay it upon the onions; have ready some
stock, boiling hot; let it simmer gently for an hour
and a quarter; then strain it through a sieve; add
two quarts more of stock, and let it stew; mix with
it three tea-spoonsful of currie powder, and two of
brown flour with a little cold water; let it boil slowly
for half an hour. If preferred, the juice of a lemon
may be strained into it.</p>

<h3>OCHRA SOUP.</h3>

<p>Wash well a dozen and a half young ochras;
slice them thin, three onions chopped fine; pour on
these five quarts of water early in the morning with
pepper and salt; let this stew slowly two hours;
then put in a piece of veal and a piece of lean bacon,
with seven or eight tomatoes, skinned and sliced;
boil it till it is thick; serve hot to table.</p>

<h3>CATFISH SOUP.</h3>

<p>Take one large catfish, clean it well, cut off the
head; then cut the fish in half; put it in a pot with
two onions, and a bunch of parsley cut up fine, and
some pepper and salt; put in a quart of water, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
stew slowly till the fish is tender; then add a pint
of milk and a quart of water; let this all simmer
for half an hour; roll a piece of butter in a little
flour: in twenty minutes after the butter and flour
go in, it will be sufficiently done.</p>

<h3>DRIED PEA SOUP.</h3>

<p>Wash a quart of dried peas well; put them in four
quarts of water to soak over night; early in the morning
place it over the fire in your soup kettle; when it
has boiled three hours, put in a small piece of salt
pork; add some salt, pepper, and two chopped onions;
after it has boiled some time take out the pork; mash
the peas, and strain the liquor through a sieve into
a kettle; put the pork in again; skim off the fat;
let it boil one hour; serve up hot with toast.</p>

<h3>GREEN PEA SOUP.</h3>

<p>Shell a quart of green peas; wash them, and put
them down to boil with three quarts of water and a
little salt; when it has boiled slowly an hour and a
half, season with pepper and a little butter rolled
in flour: boiling a few of the pods with the peas is
an improvement.</p>

<h3>BEAN SOUP.</h3>

<p>Wash the beans and soak them over night; in the
morning throw off the water, and put down the
beans with five quarts of water and a small piece of
salt pork; let it boil till the beans are perfectly
soft; then take out the pork and either strain the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
soup, or send it to table with the beans in, as preferred.</p>

<h3>CLAM SOUP.</h3>

<p>Wash the shells of a peck of clams carefully;
put them to boil in two quarts of cold water; when
the shells have opened, take off the liquor; return
it to the soup kettle; take the clams out of the shells,
put them in the pot with the seasoning; a little salt
and pepper; rub in a small piece of butter, a dessert
spoonful of flour; stir constantly till boiling hot;
add some parsley chopped fine, and a pint of milk.</p>

<h3>FISH.</h3>

<p>Fresh fish are easily told by the redness of their
gills. If the gills are white or the flesh is not hard
to the touch, reject them. They are not fresh.
Fish should be sent to table as soon as cooked.
Broiled fish should be sprinkled with salt before
broiling. When boiled, should have salt in the
water.</p>

<h3>TO BAKE A SHAD.</h3>

<p>Shad should be fat. Clean it well, take out the
inside and the gills. Score and salt the fish, make
a dressing of bread, butter, pepper, salt, parsley,
thyme and sweet marjoram; fill the fish with this;
tie it up and put it in a pan with some water: dredge
the fish with flour, let it cook slowly, baste it often;
when nearly done, add some mushroom catsup to the
gravy; season to your taste with pepper and salt.
Take it up very carefully: bake half an hour.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<h3>TO BROIL A SHAD.</h3>

<p>Cut it down the back, sprinkle it with pepper
and salt, grease your gridiron well, and put it down
on the flesh side first. Let it be well done. Send hot
to table.</p>

<h3>FRESH COD BOILED.</h3>

<p>Clean and wash it well; put it down to boil in
the fish kettle. It will cook in half an hour; take
it up carefully, garnish the dish with hard-boiled
egg, and serve with egg sauce. All boiled fish should
have salt in the water, or the fish will be insipid.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL HALIBUT.</h3>

<p>Sprinkle it with salt, tie it up in a cloth, put it
in the kettle in boiling water; let it boil slowly
till done, which will depend upon the size, allowing
eight minutes to a pound.</p>

<h3>TO FRY HALIBUT.</h3>

<p>Cut it into small pieces, season it with pepper and
salt, dip it in the yolk of egg, then into rolled
cracker: fry in hot lard, and serve it up.</p>

<h3>TURBOT.</h3>

<p>Turbot is one of the most delicious fish we have,
when properly prepared and served. It must be
washed with the greatest care, and cut down the
middle of the back, on the dark side of the fish.
Have your kettle perfectly clean; put your fish into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
boiling water, enough to cover it, with two table
spoonsful of salt; let it boil slowly, skim it frequently.
It will cook sufficiently in twenty minutes:
drain and dish it; serve up hot with butter and egg
sauce, or any other preferred.</p>

<h3>TROUT.</h3>

<p>Trout should be fried as perch.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL STURGEON.</h3>

<p>Sturgeon may be boiled as rock fish, and served
up with the same sauces. It is very good with
spiced vinegar poured over when cold.</p>

<h3>TO PICKLE FRESH HERRING.</h3>

<p>First scale and clean them well, cut off the heads,
put salt, pepper and cloves in the vinegar; boil it, and
when cold, pour over the fish in a stone jar; set the
jar on a warm stove for half a day; then put them
in a cold place.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL SHEEP’S HEAD.</h3>

<p>Sheep’s head is one of the most delicate fish, and
should be boiled as rock fish; to be eaten with egg
sauce, walnut catsup, or harvey sauce.</p>

<h3>SEA BASS.</h3>

<p>Sea bass are good either fried or boiled.</p>

<h3>HADDOCK.</h3>

<p>Haddock must be well cleaned and emptied of
its contents; take out the gills and wash them inside
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
and out with particular care; lay them in warm
water a little salted; drop in a small piece of saltpetre;
skim the water frequently, and let them simmer
from ten to fifteen minutes: serve hot with egg
and other sauces to your taste.</p>

<h3>TO DRESS A SALT COD.</h3>

<p>Put your fish in water over night to soak; add a
little vinegar to the water; wash it well: it should
not boil, but simmer slowly for half an hour, or
till tender: to be eaten with egg sauce and mashed
potatoes: when cold, mix with mashed potatoes: dip
them in egg, and fry them in hot lard.</p>

<h3>TO PICKLE SALT SALMON.</h3>

<p>Put it to soak over night; in the morning clean
the scales and put it down to boil for ten minutes;
take it up, and put it in a stone crock; boil some
vinegar with a little mace, whole pepper and allspice;
pour over the fish, and when perfectly cold,
cover and set it away: this will keep for a length of
time, and is a nice relish for tea.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL FRESH SALMON.</h3>

<p>Tie it up in a cloth and put it in the kettle with
boiling water; let it boil slowly, allowing ten minutes
to each pound; sprinkle it with salt before
putting it in the cloth; to be eaten with egg sauce
and walnut catsup, or with fish sauce.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<h3>TO BOIL FRESH MACKEREL.</h3>

<p>Sprinkle it with salt after cleaning: tie it in a
cloth, and boil as other fish. It will boil sufficiently
well in twenty-five minutes; serve with egg sauce.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL ROCK FISH.</h3>

<p>Clean and wash it well, tie it up in a cloth, boil
it in water and salt; let it boil gently according to
the size: one weighing six pounds will cook in half
an hour. Garnish the dish with hard-boiled egg;
to be eaten with egg sauce.</p>

<h3>TO FRY ROCK FISH.</h3>

<p>To fry rock fish, dip them in Indian meal and fry
in hot lard; score them and season with pepper and
salt before you fry them.</p>

<h3>TO FRY PERCH.</h3>

<p>Clean them well, and sprinkle with pepper and
salt, and fry in lard; scoring them and dipping them
in Indian meal before frying.</p>

<h3>TO FRY SMELTS.</h3>

<p>These little fish must be drawn at the gills, as
they must not be opened: they are a very delicate
fish: season them with salt; beat up the yolk of egg
very light, dip them in the egg; then in grated
cracker; fry in hot lard; serve hot.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<h3>LOBSTERS AND CRABS.</h3>

<p>After washing them, put them alive in a pot of
boiling water. Lobsters will boil in forty minutes,
or longer, if they are very large. Crabs thirty minutes.
Dress them with the yolk of hard-boiled
eggs, oil, pepper, salt, and mustard.</p>

<h3>TO STEW CLAMS.</h3>

<p>Take equal quantities of the liquor and new milk;
stew it, and when it comes to a boil, stir in the
clams; season with pepper, salt and parsley.</p>

<h3>TO FRY CLAMS.</h3>

<p>Strain them; then make a batter of the yolks of
two eggs, two table-spoonsful of flour, and a little
milk; put them in and fry in hot lard.</p>

<h3>TO STEW CRABS.</h3>

<p>Put them into a pot of boiling water for ten minutes;
then take out the meat and put it down with
the juice that runs out, and very little water, pepper,
salt, and butter; a few minutes will cook them.</p>

<h3>LOBSTER STEWED.</h3>

<p>Proceed as for crabs. Cut them into small pieces;
then stew for a few minutes; season with cayenne
pepper, salt and butter.</p>

<h3>OYSTERS BROILED.</h3>

<p>Take them from the shell and broil on an oyster
iron; season with a little pepper, salt, and butter;
serve them hot.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<h3>TO ROAST OYSTERS IN THE SHELL.</h3>

<p>Wash off the shells and place them on a large
oyster gridiron; put it over the coals; turn them
once: ten minutes will cook them.</p>

<h3>TO PICKLE OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>Put the oysters on in the juice, and boil them
plump; then take the oysters out; add half as much
vinegar as juice, a little mace, and some grains of
pepper, to your taste; boil this slowly; pour over
the oysters, and they are done.</p>

<h3>TO STEW OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>Take a hundred oysters; put them in a stew pan,
with boiling water enough to cover them; stir them
till they are plump; then take them out with a strainer;
add half as much juice as there is water in the pot,
with some mace, whole grains of pepper, and salt,
half pint of cream, and piece of butter; two crackers
rolled very fine, which sprinkle in; then put in the
oysters, and keep stirring for a few minutes, when
they will be done.</p>

<h3>OYSTER PIE.</h3>

<p>Make a puff paste; put some around the sides of
a deep dish. Have a hundred good oysters; take
each oyster out of the liquor with a wooden spoon
or fork; mash as fine as possible the yolks of two
hard-boiled eggs. Put in a layer of oysters, over
which strew a little of the egg with some mace and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
whole grains of pepper; then another layer of
oysters with the egg, and spice as above, and so fill
up the dish till the oysters are all in; strew a little
butter on the top: then place precisely in the centre
of the pie a small egg cup, so as to prevent the
top paste touching the liquor; strain the liquor,
and put in according to your judgment; cut a
cross in the centre of the paste, and open it to
let the steam escape; let it bake slowly. If you
find the paste getting too brown, put a sheet of
white paper over the top. If the oysters are fresh,
add some salt.</p>

<h3>OYSTER FRITTERS.</h3>

<p>Make a batter in the usual way; have your lard
boiling hot; drop in a spoonful of batter with an
oyster in it, and let them brown; turn them once,
so that each side may brown.</p>

<h3>SCOLLOPED OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>Put well buttered toasted bread around the sides
of a deep dish; put in the oysters; season with salt,
pepper, mace, and butter; strain into it a little of
the liquor; strew bread crumbs over it, and bake
in a quick oven.</p>

<h3>TERRAPINS.</h3>

<p>Wash them very well; then put them into a pot
of boiling water; let them stay till you can easily
take off the toe nails and the skin; take off the bottom
shell; be careful in taking out the sand bag
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
and the gall; (the gall is in the liver) cut the terrapins
up; save all the juice which runs out in cutting;
take out the eggs; put the terrapins down to
stew; season with cayenne pepper, salt; roll a piece
of butter in flour and mix in; add some wine, and
drop in the eggs just before taking them up. The
quantity of wine and butter depends very much
upon the taste of the cook; but a quarter of a pound
to two terrapins will be sufficient; and half a pint of
wine to four or five terrapins.</p>

<h3>TO FRY TRIPE.</h3>

<p>Have some lard boiling hot; cut your tripe in
pieces three inches square; dip them in butter and
fry.</p>

<h3>TO PREPARE A RENNET.</h3>

<p>A rennet is the stomach of the calf. As soon
as the calf is killed, take it; wash it very quickly,
and cover it with salt; let it lie three or four days;
then stretch it on sticks; hang it up to dry: when
dry, put it in a bag, and set it in a dry place to keep.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE SMEARCASE OR COTTAGE CHEESE.</h3>

<p>Keep thick milk near the fire till the whey
has risen; pour it in a muslin bag, and hang it in
the shade for twelve hours; then take it out and
dress it with pepper, salt, and cream.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<h2 class="antiqua">Sauces.</h2>

<h3>MELTED BUTTER.</h3>

<p>Have half a pint of water boiling hot; roll a lump
of butter the size of an egg into three teaspoonsful
of flour; when you have the butter perfectly smooth
remove the water from the fire, and stir your butter
in till every particle is dissolved. If this is carefully
done, the sauce will be perfectly smooth; then
boil ten minutes.</p>

<h3>EGG SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Boil two or three eggs hard, cut them up fine, and
put them in the drawn butter as above.</p>

<h3>CAPER AND NASTURTIAN SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Caper and nasturtian sauce is made in the same
way, always remembering to cut the nasturtians in
half: pickled cucumbers may be used in the same
manner, cut up small.</p>

<h3>OYSTER SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Oyster sauce is made in the same manner, only
putting the flour and butter into the oyster juice
instead of water; either cut the oysters in half or
send to table whole; season with mace and whole
pepper.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<h3>ONION SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Take small white onions; put them down to stew
with a little water and salt; when nearly done,
which will be in twenty minutes, drain off the water;
then add milk or cream; let them simmer gently;
rub a little flour and butter on a plate, and stir in.</p>

<h3>MINT SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Wash well a bunch of mint; chop it up fine; put
it in your sauce dish with a little vinegar and
sugar; to be eaten with lamb.</p>

<h3>CELERY SAUCE.</h3>

<p>The celery must be washed, cut up and boiled
till it is tender; have some milk boiling hot, roll
very smoothly a little butter and flour, stir till the
butter is all melted, then put in the celery; send hot
to table.</p>

<h3>LOBSTER SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Put on to boil a pint of water with a little mace,
black peppers whole, and some mustard seed; let it
boil until the water is sharp; then strain off the
water and put it on to boil with salt and some butter
rubbed in flour; cut up some lobster, and dress it
with this sauce.</p>

<h3>MUSHROOM SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Pick and wash some mushrooms; cut them up in
a stew pan with pepper, salt and a little water and
mace; let them stew twenty or thirty minutes; rub
in very little flour and butter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<h3>WINE SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Beat up a piece of butter, then add the yolks of
three eggs, and some sugar, wine and brandy; put
this on the fire, stirring it all the time; as soon as
it is boiling hot, take it off: this sauce is for puddings.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER WINE SAUCE.</h3>

<p>The quantity of the ingredients depends on the
quantity of the article you make. Have equal
quantities of wine and water, and a little brandy
boiling hot, into which put some butter and sugar
well beaten; season with nutmeg, and as soon as
boiling hot take from the fire, and send to table.</p>

<h3>CREAM SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Sweeten to your taste some good sweet cream;
season with nutmeg or rose water; this is good sauce
for apple dumplings.</p>

<h3>PEPPER SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Take twenty-five peppers cut very fine, one root
of horse-radish grated, two tablespoonsful of salt
and a tablespoonful of mustard seed, a tablespoonful
of cloves, the same of allspice, a little mace; boil
the spices in the vinegar, and pour over the peppers,
mixing all well together; put in bottles or jars,
and cork it.</p>

<h3>CELERY VINEGAR.</h3>

<p>Bruise a pint of celery seed; after putting it into
your bottles, fill them with strong cider vinegar;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
set it away for a month, not forgetting to shake it
every day: it will then be fit for use.</p>

<h3>GRAVY FOR ROAST TURKEY AND CHICKENS.</h3>

<p>Boil the liver and gizzard with a little salt;
when done, chop them up fine; mix with the water
they were boiled in, some of the drippings in the
bottom of the oven, a very little brown flour, then
add the giblets: season to your taste.</p>

<h3>VEAL GRAVY.</h3>

<p>Take some of the drippings in the bottom of
your oven, to which add some boiling water; put it
on to boil, season with pepper, salt, and a little brown
sugar and flour; send hot to table.</p>

<h3>VENISON SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Take equal quantities of claret and currant jelly,
and some brown sugar; put it down and let it stew
till thick; send hot to table; this sauce is very good
for venison or roast leg of mutton.</p>

<h3>APPLE DUMPLING SAUCE ANOTHER WAY.</h3>

<p>Beat loaf sugar and butter to a cream as light as
possible, and stir slowly into it one wine glass of
brandy. An excellent cold sauce for apple dumplings
or fritters.</p>

<h3>APPLE SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Pare a quarter of a peck of ripe green pippins;
cut them in quarters and core them; then put them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
in a pipkin or earthen pitcher, with a little water
to stew slowly; shake the pipkin or pitcher frequently;
do not put a spoon in; it might break them
when nearly done: put in a little loaf sugar; shake
them several times; when done, pour them into a dish
without breaking: serve up cold or hot.</p>

<h3>CRANBERRY SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Wash and pick four quarts of cranberries; put
them in a bell-metal kettle with one quart of water
to stew slowly: when half done, add two pounds of
brown sugar: every berry must be broken with a
spoon before it comes off the fire: stir frequently.
Another way would be to add more sugar and strain
it through a fine cullender, and set it away in forms
to cool: this we would call cranberry jelly.</p>

<h3>TO STEW DRIED FRUIT.</h3>

<p>Dried fruit should be well washed in three or four
different waters, and put to soak over night in the
water in which you intend stewing them; to four
quarts of fruit, put water enough to cover them,
so that none need be added while cooking: season
and sweeten to your taste. Some persons like
dried orange peel in peaches.</p>

<h3>TO ROAST BEEF.</h3>

<p>Scrape till clean the fat, the lean, and the bones
of the beef. If any soil remain on the bones, saw
it off with a beef saw. It can be more thoroughly
cleaned in this way than in any other. It spoils
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
beef to wash it. Spit it and put it in a tin kitchen
before the fire, with a half pint of water in the bottom
of the kitchen; do not set it close to the fire at
first, but bring it gradually nearer; turn, and baste
it every few minutes. It should be cooked slowly.
When nearly done, season with black and cayenne
pepper and salt. The habit of dredging beef with
flour is a very bad one. Flour is no improvement
to beef. Ten pounds of beef will roast, before a
good fire, in two hours. For the gravy, pour off
the grease, add a little water, pepper and salt; send
to table in a gravy boat. This receipt will answer
for any part of the beef that is fit to roast. Garnish
with horse-radish, grated. All roasts should
be well skewered to the spit.</p>

<h3>BEEF STEAKS.</h3>

<p>The sirloin is the best. Cut the steak half an
inch thick; put it on a gridiron over clear coals;
turn it very often; when half done, put it on a dish
and squeeze as much of the juice out as possible;
put it back; season with pepper and salt. When
done, place it in the dish with the juice; add a
spoonful of water, and if you prefer, a small piece
of butter: send to the table immediately.</p>

<h3>TO STEW BEEF.</h3>

<p>Cut all the meat from cold roast beef; put the
bones down with some water, pepper, salt, onions,
carrots and potatoes, all cut up: a little brown stock
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
will improve it: let it stew till all of the vegetables
are done; then take out the bones, cut your meat
in small pieces, rub a piece of butter in flour and
stir in: put the meat in till it is hot through; then
dish it.</p>

<h3>BEEF A LA MODE.</h3>

<p>Chop fine some parsley, thyme and onions; add
some grated bread, nutmeg, cloves, pepper and salt,
with the yolks of three eggs beaten; take out the
bone and fill the space with these ingredients well
mixed; make holes in the lean part and stuff it; bind
it firmly with tape; put it into an iron pot, sufficiently
large to hold it, cover it with water and let it
stew slowly for three hours. Make a gravy of the
liquor it was stewed in with a half pint of red wine
and mushroom catsup; rub a little butter in flour,
and let it simmer five minutes; then take it up.</p>

<h3>A BRISKET OF BEEF BAKED.</h3>

<p>Take a brisket, say ten pounds; make a dressing
of ham, parsley, oysters, seasoned with pounded
cloves, pepper, salt and nutmeg, and the yolk of two
eggs well beaten; make holes in the beef and stuff
it; put it in a pan with a little water and half a
pint of wine; bake it three hours; send hot to table.
Garnish with sliced lemons.</p>

<h3>BEEF STEAK PIE.</h3>

<p>Stew some tender pieces of beef, cut it up in small
pieces, season with pepper and salt; have some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
good paste in a deep dish, into which put the pieces
of beef with some gravy; put on a cover and bake.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL CORN BEEF.</h3>

<p>Wash it well, and soak it thirty or forty minutes;
put it down to boil in plenty of cold water: let it boil
slowly, and skim often.</p>

<h3>A BEEF’S HEART.</h3>

<p>Cut the heart open; let it soak in cold water for
a few moments, then take out the ventricles; put it
down to boil; when nearly done, take it up: make a
dressing of small pieces of ham, pepper, salt, parsley,
and some beef chopped fine; make incisions with a
knife; stuff and bake it; pour a pint of the water
in which it was boiled in the pan for gravy, and
thicken it with browned flour and butter.</p>

<h3>DIRECTIONS FOR COOKING THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF VEAL.</h3>

<p>The fore quarter, the rack, and breast, are best
boiled. The fillet or leg is very good stuffed and
baked. The loin should be roasted. The knuckle
is proper for soup, also the neck and shoulder.</p>

<h3>TO ROAST A LOIN OF VEAL.</h3>

<p>Wash it well, and put it in a tin kitchen some distance
from the fire; when it is hot through, place it
nearer to the fire; baste it well; when nearly done,
dredge it with flour; add pepper and salt; the
time it takes to cook will depend on the size of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
loin; put half a pint of water in the tin kitchen when
you set it to the fire; garnish the dish with sliced
lemons.</p>

<h3>VEAL CUTLETS.</h3>

<p>Cut the cutlets half an inch thick; have some
cracker rolled with pepper, salt, and nutmeg; dip
your cutlets in the yolk of egg well beaten; then in
grated cracker; fry in hot lard slowly till done,
then take them up: make the gravy by pouring a
pint of cream with some chopped parsley in the pan
in which it has been cooked; season with grated
nutmeg: garnish your dish with curled parsley.</p>

<h3>BAKED FILLET OF VEAL.</h3>

<p>Take the leg or fillet of veal; wash it well; cut
off the shank and trim it, so that it will sit nicely in
the pan; make a stuffing of bread crumbs, pepper,
salt, parsley and nutmeg, some butter and the yolks
of eggs; stuff the fillet and bake it: put a little water
in the pan, and some mushroom catsup in the gravy.</p>

<h3>TO STEW VEAL.</h3>

<p>Cut your veal in small pieces; slice three onions;
fry them in butter; then put the veal down with a little

or catsup.</p>

<h3>MOCK TURTLE OR CALF’S HEAD.</h3>

<p>Clean the head well; let it soak for a few minutes
in cold water; take out the lower jaw, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
nose and the eyes: then put it down to boil; skim it
well, and when the bones will fall from the meat,
cut the meat in small pieces; take out carefully all
the small bones; have some onions chopped fine,
nutmeg, mace, cloves, pepper, salt, bread crumbs,
butter and egg, all well mixed together; put these
nicely arranged in a pan with some of the gravy;
put egg and butter on the top; bake it twenty minutes
in an oven; when done, take it up; season the
gravy with red wine and mushroom catsup.</p>

<h3>TO STEW CALF’S FEET.</h3>

<p>Have your feet nicely cleaned and cut in two;
boil them till tender; take out the large bones; put
them down to stew with some of the liquor they
were boiled in, pepper, salt and parsley chopped
fine; rub a dessert spoonful of butter in two of flour,
and stir in. Garnish your dish with curled parsley.</p>

<h3>SWEET-BREADS.</h3>

<p>Sweet-breads must always be parboiled. Have
a dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, parsley
and butter; stuff the sweet breads and roast; or
fry them like oysters, cutting them into small pieces.</p>

<h3>SWEET-BREAD AND OYSTER PIE.</h3>

<p>Stew the sweet-breads till tender; have a dish
lined with a good paste; cut the sweet-bread up in
small pieces; put some in the paste with some oysters,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
pepper, salt, butter and the yolks of eggs boiled
hard and mashed fine; then another layer of sweet
bread and oysters till your dish is full; put on a
top paste and bake; cut a cross in the middle, and
turn it back to let the steam escape: send hot to
table. Have a small egg-cup in the centre of the
pie, to keep the upper crust from touching the liquor.</p>

<h3>TO ROAST A LOIN OF MUTTON.</h3>

<p>Wash it well, and put it down in the tin kitchen,

till done: add some butter before you take it from
the fire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<h3>STEAKS OF MUTTON.</h3>

<p>Have your slices a quarter of an inch thick; dip
them in boiling lard, then into grated bread seasoned
with pepper and salt, and broil on a gridiron, first
rubbing off the bars with lard, that none may drip
or cause a smell. These are also very good dressed
like veal cutlets.</p>

pickle and pour over it: it will be sufficiently cured
in eight days. When wanted for summer use, let
it remain in brine between three or four weeks;
then hang it up to dry; smoke very little.</p>

<h3>TO SOUSE PIG’S FEET.</h3>

<p>Clean well the feet, and let them lie in salt and
water over night, then boil till tender; take out the
large bones, cut them down the middle; dip them in
flour and fry in hot lard, or, pick out all the bones;
season with pepper and salt, and if liked, some vinegar;
heat them for a few moments when required.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<h3>TO CURE BEEF’S TONGUES.</h3>

<p>Rub each tongue well with brown sugar and saltpetre;
have ready an earthen crock or wooden vessel;
put into it a layer of salt, then a tongue, then
a layer of salt, and so on till they are all in; after
they have been in three days, remove them and put
the tongues which were in the bottom of the vessel
on top: they will make their own pickle.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL HAM.</h3>

<p>If a ham is old and hard, it should soak over night;
if not, wash it well, and put it down in plenty of cold
water: the water should be well skimmed while boiling.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL A STUFFED HAM.</h3>

<p>Make incisions in the ham with a knife; have
ready some mint chopped fine, with which fill them;
then boil for five or six hours; trim, but do not
skin it.</p>

<h3>TO BAKE A BOILED HAM.</h3>

<p>First, boil till done; then skin and trim it; spread
the yolk of egg over, then sprinkle with finely
rolled cracker, and put in the oven for a few minutes;
or, you may boil, skin it, and ornament with black
pepper: a ham will keep much better, and will retain
the juice, if the skin is not taken off.</p>

<h3>TO CURE HAMS AND SHOULDERS.</h3>

<p>Cut up your hogs, take out the chine from the
neck to the tail, cut the hams, shoulders, and middlings;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
have some finely powdered saltpetre; rub a
tablespoonful in each ham for some minutes, then
rub it well with salt and brown sugar; let them lie
on a board some distance apart for three days, to
draw off the blood; have a molasses barrel; sprinkle
the bottom with salt and put in your hams with the
skins down; sprinkle with salt, and so on till you
have the barrel full; make a strong pickle that will
bear an egg; pour over them, cover, and let them
remain in pickle for five weeks, then hang them up
with the hock down to preserve the juice. The
shoulders will not require to be in pickle so long; it
is not necessary to put saltpetre on the middlings;
the jowls will be ready to hang up in two weeks,
shoulders and middlings in four: they should be
smoked but three times a week till done; if smoked
too much, they will be hard. Before the weather
gets warm, take them down and rub well with hickory
ashes.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL AND FREEZE CHINE.</h3>

<p>After the chines have been in pickle a week or
ten days, boil them and let them freeze. They are
considered a great delicacy.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE SAUSAGE MEAT.</h3>

<p>Take the tender pieces of pork, lean and fat, one
third fat and two thirds lean, season with salt and
pepper, and those that are for immediate use are
improved by putting in some sage finely pulverized,
but if kept too long, it will have a musty taste. If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
sausage meat is put in to skins, laid for ten days in
pickle, then hung up and smoked a little, they will
keep all summer. Those that are not put into
skins, should be put into stone crocks, and have
lard run over the top to exclude the air.</p>

<h3>HOG’S HEAD CHEESE.</h3>

<p>Wash the heads well, take off the ears and nose,
and remove the eyes; boil them till tender, and all the

all the bones; cut up the meat very fine: then season
with pepper and salt; put this back again into

in the tin kitchen with some salt and water; baste
it frequently. A large goose will take an hour and a
half to cook: make a gravy with the giblets hashed;
season with pepper and salt. Some persons prefer
the dressing made of potatoes. Ducks are done
in the same way, but will cook in half an hour: to
be eaten with cranberry sauce.</p>

<h3>TO ROAST A TURKEY.</h3>

rice; skim it and let it boil slowly, but constantly,
till done; make a filling of bread, butter, pepper,
salt, and some whole oysters, and a few slices of lemon.
It is better to put the turkey in a cloth. A
large turkey will boil in two hours; to be eaten with
oyster or celery sauce.</p>

<h3>TO ROAST CHICKENS.</h3>

<p>Make a dressing, as for turkey; set them some
distance from the fire at first, but move them gradually
closer: they will roast in an hour: baste them

a little water, pepper, salt and a little butter rolled
in flour.</p>

<h3>WILD DUCKS.</h3>

<p>When the ducks are picked, wash them as little
as possible: roast twenty minutes. Some persons
make a filling of bread, butter, pepper and salt;
but the proper way is to cook them without filling;
baste them very often and turn rapidly; put a little
water in the bottom of the oven.</p>

<h3>TO ROAST WOODCOCK OR SNIPE.</h3>

<p>Pick them very carefully, but do not draw them;
they will cook sufficiently in ten or fifteen minutes;
have some toast on a dish, upon which put the birds.</p>

<h3>TO ROAST PHEASANTS.</h3>

<p>Chop up fine any kind of cold meat, fowl, ham,
and pork; mix all well together; add salt and pepper,
and mustard to the taste, some grated bread,

Parmesan cheese is the best, but any other kind will
answer.</p>

<p>Take cold chicken or meat of any kind and stew
it; when done cut it up. Have potatoes mashed,
which put around the sides and bottom of the dish
about half an inch thick; then put in your stew with
the liquor; season with pepper and salt; spread some
macaroni which has been boiled on the top of the
dish, with grated cheese, butter, pepper and salt;
bake, and bring to table in the dish in which it is
baked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<h3>CHICKEN SALAD.</h3>

<p>One pair of chickens, eight bunches of celery, six
eggs, one dessert spoonful of mustard, nearly a bottle
of oil, pepper and salt. Boil the chickens; take
off the skins: cut them up in small pieces; sprinkle
them with pepper, salt and vinegar, and let them
lie three hours; moisten the mustard with vinegar;
then pour in the oil, a few drops at a time, and
keep constantly stirring it; have the eggs boiled
hard; mash them up with a little vinegar, and then
mix with the oil; cut up your celery very fine and
throw it into cold water; when the ingredients are
all ready, mix the chicken and celery; (after draining
it) then pour the dressing over it. Curl some
pieces of celery by cutting it up about an inch and
throwing it into cold water, with which garnish the
dish.</p>

<h3>ITALIAN MACARONI.</h3>

<p>Break the macaroni into pieces two inches long;
boil it in hot water, with a little butter, pepper and
salt; when done, drain it on a napkin; then put a
layer of macaroni on the bottom of a dish; pour

being on the top; put it in the oven a few minutes,
and serve it hot.</p>

<h3>MACARONI WITH CREAM.</h3>

<p>Boil half a pound of macaroni in hot water, and
when done cut it into pieces; put it into a pan with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
a quarter of a pound of butter, two ounces of grated
cheese, and half a gill of cream; add a little pepper,
salt and mustard; shake it over the fire until well
mixed and quite hot; dish it, and garnish with pieces
of puff paste cut in diamonds.</p>

<h3>OMELETTE WITH CHEESE.</h3>

<p>Beat six eggs very light; add to them two tablespoonsful
of cream, butter the size of a walnut, a
spoonful of chopped parsley, some pepper and salt,
two ounces of grated cheese; beat all well together,
and pour into a pan in which butter is melting; let
it cook until a light brown; then fold up and dish
for the table. Shake the pan while the omelet is
doing.</p>

<h3>OMELETTE WITH OYSTERS.</h3>

<p>Beat six eggs separately, very light; add to the
yolks a little mustard, cayenne pepper and salt;
mix this with the whites; pour it into a pan in which
butter is melting, and cook till a light brown. Before
folding, have a few nicely scolloped oysters and
lay between; shake the pan about till the omelet is
done.</p>

<h3>EGG TOAST.</h3>

<p>Toast four slices of bread, a light brown; butter
them well, and sprinkle on a little salt. Poach
four eggs in muffin rings to retain their shape; place
one on each slice of toast, and send to the table.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<h3>CROQUETTES OF SWEET-BREADS.</h3>

<p>Take six sweet-breads, and after being well washed
stew them until done; when cold cut them into small
pieces; season with pepper, salt, a grated nutmeg,
and a little mushroom catsup; stir them over the
fire a few minutes; then spread them on a dish to
cool; the croquettes must then be shaped; rolled in
egg and bread crumbs, and fried in lard.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL EGGS.</h3>

<p>Boiling eggs depends upon the person for whom
you cook. Two minutes and a half will boil to suit
most persons: if you want them very soft, two minutes
will answer. If hard, they will take ten minutes.</p>

<h3>TO FRY EGGS.</h3>

<p>Have the lard hot, but not boiling; put in the
eggs one at a time; when done, send hot to table.</p>

<h3>TO POACH EGGS.</h3>

<p>Have ready a pan of boiling water with muffin
rings, into which put the eggs, one in each ring;
let them remain on the fire till the whites are firm.</p>

<h3>SCRAMBLED EGGS.</h3>

<p>Beat the eggs with pepper, salt, parsley and
chives; have some butter in a saucepan; as soon
as it has melted put in the eggs; stir till they are
done.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<h3>OMELET SOUFFLE.</h3>

<p>Beat the eggs separately till very light; then mix

butter hot in a pan; put in the omelet; stir the
whites in just before you put it in the pan; you can
put in ham, oysters, onions, chives, or any thing
you prefer. Keep the pan moving till the omelet
is done; a little cream is an improvement.</p>

<h2 class="antiqua">Vegetables.</h2>

<h3>TO DRESS SALAD.</h3>

<p>The lettuce should be gathered early in the morning;
pick and wash it well; let it lie in water till
required: then drain the water from it. Have eggs
boiled hard, oil, mustard, pepper and salt, according
to taste. Ornament with slices of hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<h3>CAULIFLOWER.</h3>

<p>Get those that are hard and white; cut off the
stalk; take off the outside leaves; put it down to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
boil in hot water, with a little salt: a large one will
take half an hour. Do not let it boil too much:
eat with drawn butter.</p>

<h3>PARSNIPS.</h3>

<p>Scrape and wash them: cover them with water,
and let them boil till tender, which will be from one
to two hours: send to table with butter, pepper and
salt, or fry them brown.</p>

<h3>CARROTS.</h3>

<p>Let them be scraped and washed; boil them; try
them with a fork; if they are tender, they are done;
dress with drawn butter.</p>

<h3>TURNIPS.</h3>

<p>Pare, wash and cut up; put them on to boil; when
done, take them up; mash them in a tin pan: season
with pepper, salt, and butter; send hot to table.</p>

<h3>SALSIFY OR OYSTER PLANT.</h3>

<p>Wash and scrape them well; put them down to
boil; when soft, mash and season with pepper and
salt: make a batter of milk, flour and egg. Mix all
well together; drop them the size of oysters with a
tablespoon, and fry them a light brown.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Have the water boiling. Put in the potatoes;
let them boil till nearly done, then pour off the water
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
and throw in some salt; uncover the saucepan and
set them on the back part of the stove. If the potatoes
are boiled fast, the skin will crack before they
are done. For mashed potatoes, pare them before you
boil them; when done, mash them with a small piece
of butter, a cup of cream, and a little salt. Another
way to boil old potatoes is to pare them around the
middle, before you boil them, and throw in a little
salt. When potatoes are young, scrape and boil
them; when done, pour off the water and dress them
with a little cream, butter, pepper and salt.</p>

<h3>TO FRY POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Pare large potatoes; cut them lengthwise: cut
them into four pieces, of about a quarter of an inch
thick. Have some butter boiling hot into which put
the potatoes; keep turning them till they are done.
Sprinkle a little salt on them before sending them
to table.</p>

<h3>TO STEW POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Slice the potatoes and put them down to boil,
with just enough water to cover them; when nearly
done, pour off the water, and add milk and a lump
of butter rolled in flour, parsley and salt.</p>

<h3>MASHED POTATOES.</h3>

<p>You can make mashed potatoes into any shape
you wish them. Touch them over with the yolk of
egg, and put them in an oven to brown.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<h3>TO ROAST POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Large potatoes will roast in an hour. Do not
put them too near the fire, or they will burn before
they are cooked. Sweet potatoes, if they are large,
will take an hour and a half to roast.</p>

<h3>TO FRY SWEET POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Parboil them, then peel; cut them in slices, and
fry in butter: send them hot to table.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL SWEET POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Have them as nearly of a size as possible. Put
them in boiling water; as soon as they are done,
(which will depend upon the size,) pour off the water;
then lay them on the back part of the stove, where
they will dry, but not burn. Some persons parboil
them, cut them in two, and broil them over a
gridiron.</p>

<h3>SPINACH.</h3>

<p>Take great care in picking it; wash it well, and
put it in a steamer with a little salt. It will cook
in twenty minutes. Have some toast on a dish;
put your spinach on the toast, and some poached
eggs on the top.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL GREENS.</h3>

<p>Cabbage sprouts are better boiled with a piece of
pork or bacon. Eat with hard-boiled eggs, and if
cooked without the meat, have drawn butter or
vinegar.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<h3>LIMA BEANS.</h3>

<p>Lima beans will require about three quarters of
an hour to boil. Put them on in cold water; when
done, drain them: season with pepper, salt and butter.</p>

<h3>STRING BEANS.</h3>

<p>String and cut them down the middle; put them
down in as little water as you can cook them in,
without burning them: do not strain off the water,
but let them cook till nearly all the water has evaporated:
season with butter, pepper and salt, and
send to table.</p>

<h3>PEAS.</h3>

<p>Shell and wash the peas. Cook them just as the
beans. This is the best way to cook peas and beans;
or you can boil them in the common way, and drain
off the water: season with butter, pepper and salt.</p>

<h3>ASPARAGUS.</h3>

<p>Scrape and wash the asparagus; tie it up in bunches;
and put it on to boil in water in which there is
some salt; it requires about fifteen minutes to boil it,
and it must not remain in the water after it is done.
Have some bread nicely toasted, on which place it,
and pour over drawn butter. A better way is to
cook it in just as little water as possible; do not
pour off the water, but let it evaporate as much as
possible; then season with butter, pepper and salt,
and send to table with the liquor around it. This
is the German manner of cooking beans, peas, and
asparagus.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<h3>TO FRICASEE CORN.</h3>

<p>Have young corn cut from the cob. Save the
juice; put it down to stew with pepper, salt, and a
little cream; roll a lump of butter in flour, and stir
in. If the corn is young, it will cook in twenty minutes.
Corn will boil in half an hour; put it in
boiling water, and take it up as soon as done.</p>

<h3>TO KEEP CORN FOR WINTER.</h3>

<p>Get the corn when young. Boil it ten minutes;
a longer time would injure it; cut it from the cob;
spread it on dishes, and put it in the oven after the
bread comes out; be careful the oven is not too hot;
if it is, the corn will be spoiled. If not dry enough,
put it in the sun for a few days, stirring it frequently.
When perfectly dry, tie it up in bags and keep it
in a dry place. When you cook it, wash it well:
put it down with a little water, butter, pepper and
salt. It will require much longer to cook than it
does in summer.</p>

<h3>HOMINY.</h3>

<p>Wash it well, and soak it over night in the water
you intend to boil it in; put it on early in the morning
with a few beans and a piece of salt pork. Let
it boil slowly for three hours or more, if not soft.</p>

<h3>TO FRY HOMINY.</h3>

<p>After your hominy is boiled and cold, mash and
season with pepper and salt; have some lard hot in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
a pan, into which put your hominy. Cover it for
five minutes, then stir it well, and cover again, and
let it fry a light brown. Fried hominy is very good
for breakfast.</p>

<h3>TO FRY EGG PLANT.</h3>

<p>Pare and let them lie ten or fifteen minutes in
salt and water, to take away the bitter taste; wipe
them perfectly dry; have ready cracker rolled fine,
and seasoned with pepper and salt; dip each piece
in the yolk of an egg beaten, then in the rolled
cracker, and fry in hot lard.</p>

<h3>TO STEW EGG PLANT.</h3>

<p>Cut in half with the skin on, then soak in vinegar
to extract the bitter taste, say half an hour, then
boil till quite tender; scrape out the pulp and fill
them with bread crumbs, butter, cayenne pepper and
salt; lay them open in your bake pan with a little
water in the bottom, put them in the oven and baste
them often so that they will not be dry; rub a little
flour and butter together for the gravy.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER WAY.</h3>

<p>Prepare as above, and mix with pepper, salt, butter,
and bread crumbs; fry in sweet oil.</p>

<h3>TO STEW TOMATOES.</h3>

<p>Take off the skins by pouring boiling water over
them; then stew them with butter, pepper and salt;
put in a little soda to correct the acidity; pour in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
some cream, and stew for a few minutes longer.
Some persons prefer them without cream, and then
it is not necessary to use the soda.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER WAY.</h3>

<p>Wash and boil your tomatoes whole; then pass
them through a hair sieve; season with butter, pepper
and salt; let them stew some twenty minutes,
and serve. Or dress them with sugar and a little
wine.</p>

<h3>TO BROIL TOMATOES.</h3>

<p>Wash some large ripe tomatoes: wipe them dry;
put them on a gridiron over hot coals to broil; when
they are hot through, they are done; send them hot
to table: to be eaten with butter, pepper and salt.</p>

<h3>TO BAKE TOMATOES.</h3>

<p>Have some large ripe tomatoes; wash and peel
them; cut them up in a dish&mdash;have ready bread,
butter, pepper and salt; put a layer of tomatoes,
then the bread crumbs, butter, pepper and salt, and
so on, till your dish is full; bake, and send them to
table in the dish in which they were baked.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER WAY.</h3>

<p>Take some large tomatoes; peel them, cut the top
off, and take out some of the seeds; have ready some
mushrooms chopped fine to fill them; season with
butter, pepper and salt; then put them in a pan, and
bake them; serve up hot.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<h3>ANOTHER WAY.</h3>

<p>Peel your tomatoes; slice them and put down to
stew; season with some onions cut fine, bread crumbs,
butter, pepper and salt; they will be sufficiently
done in twenty minutes. Some persons prefer a little
flour rolled in butter.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL CORN.</h3>

<p>Take off carefully all the silk and all the husks.
Put the corn in boiling water: if young and tender,
it will boil in half an hour. Some persons serve it
up in a napkin on the dish, but if it is sufficiently
cooked, and can be served hot, it is better not to be
steamed in a napkin.</p>

<h3>TOMATOES AND OCHRAS.</h3>

<p>Take some tomatoes; skin and cut them up with
equal quantities of ochras; season with pepper, salt
and butter; stew them till tender; which will be
nearly an hour. Ochras may be stewed alone, seasoned
with butter, pepper and salt: add very little
water when you put them down.</p>

<h3>EGGS AND TOMATOES.</h3>

<p>Skin some tomatoes; slice and fry them with butter,
pepper and salt; cut up two onions, and put in with
four eggs; stir all well together, and send hot to table.</p>

<h3>TO DRY OCHRAS FOR WINTER.</h3>

<p>Get the young ochras; slice and string them; hang
them up to dry; when dry, put them away for soup
in winter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<h3>CUCUMBERS.</h3>

<p>Gather them fresh. Pare, slice and lay them in
salt and water; just before dinner, pour off the
water; season with pepper, salt, vinegar and onions.</p>

<h3>SQUASHES.</h3>

<p>Squashes should be young and tender; try them
with a fork; if they are old, do not use them. Peel
them and take out the seed; cut them in pieces and
boil till tender; when done, pass them through a
cullender. Stew with butter, pepper, salt and a
little cream; send them hot to table.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL BEETS.</h3>

<p>The early turnip beet is best in summer: wash
them, but do not cut the tops too close, as they are
much sweeter with some of the tops boiled on them.
They will boil in three quarters of an hour; when
done, take them up, put them in cold water for a
moment, so that the skin will easily peel off. Slice
them, and season with pepper, salt and butter. Old,
or winter beets, will take much longer. They will
take from two to three hours to boil. It is better
to put them to soak over night, if they are very solid:
cut them in slices, and pour vinegar over them.</p>

<h3>TO COOK ONIONS.</h3>

<p>The small white onions are preferred. Peel
them, and put them down in a little water and salt;
when nearly done, pour off the water, and add milk
and a little flour mixed with butter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<h3>TO KEEP VEGETABLES FOR WINTER.</h3>

<p>Salsify, parsnips, beets, and carrots should be
gathered in the early part of November. Those
you want to use during the winter should be put in
boxes, and covered with sand. Celery should be
put in a box with the roots down, covered with sand.
Some gardeners keep it in the ground all winter,
and dig it as they wish it, for use.</p>

<h3>TO STEW MUSHROOMS.</h3>

<p>Wash and peel the mushrooms; put them down
in a stew pan with a little water, pepper, salt and
butter; let them stew slowly for ten or fifteen minutes;
then take them up. They are very good
broiled.</p>

<h3>HOT OR COLD SLAW.</h3>

<p>The hard white cabbage is the best for slaw.
Wash it well, and cut it fine; have some butter
boiling hot; put in the slaw and keep stirring till it
is shrivelled: then beat up some vinegar and the
yolk of an egg: season with pepper and salt; pour
this in the pan over the slaw, and stir in till quite
hot: send to table either hot or cold, as preferred.</p>

<h3>COLD SLAW.</h3>

<p>Cut fine some hard cabbage; dress with hard-boiled
eggs, oil, vinegar, mustard, pepper and salt.</p>

<h3>TO BOIL CABBAGE.</h3>

<p>Wash your cabbage well; cut it in two, and boil
till tender in salt and water. Some persons prefer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
it boiled with a piece of pork or bacon. If it is
boiled with bacon, the pot should be well skimmed
before the cabbage goes in.</p>

<h3>BROCOLI.</h3>

<p>Pick and wash it well; tie it up in bunches and
boil it; when done, drain it and serve it up with
drawn butter. Put a little salt in the water when
nearly boiled.</p>

<h3>SEA KALE.</h3>

<p>Sea kale is cooked in the same way as brocoli.</p>

<h3>BUTTER.</h3>

<p>In winter the pans should be scalded before the
milk is strained into them; in summer the pans and
strainer should be rinsed with cold water. Do not
cover the milk until it is perfectly cold; a stone
crock is the best for keeping the cream in, and it
should be stirred two or three times a day; if the
cream is not stirred, the butter will have a bad taste;
do not let your milk stand too long, or this will
make the butter taste very unpleasant. Be particular
to put cold water in your churn the night before
you wish to use it; pour it out in the morning, and
rinse it again; before the butter comes, or while it is
gathering, take off the lid of the churn; have your
butter-bowl scalded and cooled; work the milk out
well, but do not put in any water; add salt to your
taste. Everything connected with milk or butter
should be kept very carefully clean.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<h3>TO KEEP BUTTER.</h3>

<p>Butter, to keep, should be well worked; pack it
in stone jars, and tie it up tight, and set it in a cool
place.</p>

<h3>TO KEEP EGGS.</h3>

<p>Get eggs as fresh as possible; put a layer of salt
in a jar; then put in some eggs, the small end down,
then another layer of salt, then the eggs; be careful
not to let the eggs touch each other; set them
in a dry cool place, and they will keep all winter.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE COFFEE.</h3>

<p>Coffee should be roasted with great care, to a dark
brown colour, stirring it all the time it is on the fire,
with a long-handled iron spoon; when it is done, put
it in a stone jar, and cover it up. Freshly roasted
coffee is much the best; grind it into a bowl, beat it
up with part of the white of an egg, and cold water;
put it into the tin coffee-pot, and pour on it boiling
water, out of a tea-kettle, stirring it all the while;
set it on the fire, and let it boil fifteen minutes; stir
it frequently from the sides of the pot; when it is
done, set it a moment on the hearth, and it will settle;
do not pour into it either cold or warm water, or
coffee, to settle it: this spoils the coffee. Pour it
into your silver or china coffee pot, and send to
table.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE TEA.</h3>

<p>Black tea should be boiled fifteen or twenty minutes.
Green tea should not boil: but have boiling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
water poured on about five minutes before it comes
to table.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE CHOCOLATE.</h3>

<p>Have a quart of good milk boiling; grate a piece
of chocolate three inches square; mix it with a little
cold milk; then stir it gradually into the milk on
the fire. If preferred thinner, use less chocolate.
It should boil at least half an hour.</p>

<h3>YEAST.</h3>

<p>Pare six good-sized potatoes; put them on to boil
with three pints of water and a handful of hops;
pour the water through a sieve on a pint of flour; stir
it until perfectly smooth; mash your potatoes through
a cullender into the yeast; stir all well together, and
let it stand till nearly cold; then stir into it a pint
bowl half full of dry yeast, dissolved in water; put
the water on the dry yeast as soon as you mix your
flour and potatoes, and when it has sufficiently cooled,
your yeast will be ready to go in. Set it in a warm
place to rise. When it is light enough, keep it in
a cool place; cover it close. Yeast should be made
the day before you bake; then it is good and fresh.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE DRY YEAST.</h3>

<p>Make as directed above. When perfectly light,
stir in corn meal till it is quite dry; spread it on
dishes to dry. Be careful not to let it be in the sun,
as this would sour it. When dry, put it in a bag, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
a dry, cool place. In summer time, when the flies
are numerous, spread a thin piece of gauze over to
keep them off when it is drying.</p>

<h3>BREAD.</h3>

<p>Sift the flour; put it in an earthen vessel; the
quantity of flour you take will depend upon the number
of loaves you want. Four loaves of bread will
require two quarts of water; pour the water, which
may be as warm as milk just from the cow, upon
the flour, enough to make a thick batter; put in two
tablespoonsful of salt, and a pint of home-made yeast;
do not beat it after the yeast goes in. Set it in a
warm place to rise; when it is light, work it very
well with flour. The more you knead it, the better.
If the flour is running, the bread will require to be
made stiffer than when it is superfine flour. Let it
rise again, covering it, and set it in a warm place.
When it is broken on top, make it into loaves, with
as little flour as possible. Put each loaf into a
basket: cover it over, and set it to rise again.
When quite light, bake it in a brick oven, from three
quarters to one hour.</p>

<h3>TO BAKE IN A BRICK OVEN.</h3>

<p>A brick oven will require one hour to heat. The
wood should be split fine; make a little fire at first,
then add more wood; when the oven is white at the
top, it is sufficiently hot. Spread the coals over
the bottom of the oven, and let them remain a quarter
of an hour.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>Rusk or biscuit, if they are very light, will bake in
from ten to fifteen minutes. Bread requires one hour.</p>

<h3>PHILADELPHIA BUNNS.</h3>

<p>One pound of flour, and a half pound of sugar,
one pint of milk, with one teaspoonful of soda, a few
currants, and half a pound of butter, a tea-cup full of
yeast. Mix all well, and let it rise; when well risen,
put in six eggs, beaten separately: pour it in the pans,
and let it rise again; then bake.</p>

<h3>BREAD ROLLS.</h3>

<p>When your bread is very light, take a piece of
dough, into which rub a small piece of butter; make
them into rolls a quarter of an inch thick: let them
rise, and bake.</p>

<h3>DIET BREAD.</h3>

<p>Rub into a pound of flour, one tablespoonful of
butter, and a teaspoonful of salt: work it very well,
or beat it; roll very thin: stick with a fork, and
bake.</p>

<h3>MUSH ROLLS.</h3>

<p>Have a pint of corn mush; when a little warm,
add a little salt and flour, enough to make a dough;
add a tea-cup full of yeast; let it rise, and when quite
light, make into rolls; let them rise again, and bake.
You can put a little butter with them, if you prefer:
but they are very palatable without.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<h3>RISEN MUFFINS.</h3>

<p>Warm a quart of milk, into which put a quarter
pound of butter, enough flour to make a batter, two
eggs, well beaten, and a cup of yeast, a little salt;
when quite light, bake in rings. Do not beat them
after the yeast is in: they will be light enough in
three hours.</p>

<h3>SODA CAKES, VERY SUPERIOR.</h3>

<p>Sift into three pints of flour, three teaspoonsful
of cream of tartar; rub one quarter of a pound of
butter in the flour; dissolve one teaspoonful of soda
in as much milk as will make a dough, thick enough
to roll out; then take a large spoonful, sift flour on
the board, roll out and bake: do not touch them with
the hands.</p>

<h3>PHILADELPHIA MILK BISCUIT.</h3>

<p>Rub half a pound of butter in three pounds of
flour, a teaspoonful of salt; warm the milk and pour
on enough to make a thick batter; beat it well, then
add a cup of good yeast. Do not beat it after the
yeast goes in; let it rise; when quite light mix in
flour, enough to make it out, but as little as possible:
roll it out and cut into cakes with a small tumbler:
let them rise again, and bake as soon as light.</p>

<h3>TWIST ROLLS.</h3>

<p>Twist rolls are made in the same way, only make
in small twists or rings, and bake.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<h3>LIGHT BISCUIT.</h3>

<p>Have a quart of milk a little warm, into which
put two spoonsful of butter; pour this on flour,
enough to make a dough; add a tea-cup full of yeast,
and a little salt; let it rise three hours, when roll
into cakes: put them in pans: let them rise again,
and bake.</p>

<h3>TEA BISCUIT.</h3>

<p>Warm a pint of good milk, into which put a piece
of butter, the size of an egg; pour this on some flour,
with a little salt and a tea-cup full of yeast. When
quite light, knead it well; roll out and bake in pans.
When done, pull them open and butter them.</p>

<h3>GERMAN CAKES.</h3>

<p>Cut up into a pound of flour, lard the size of an
egg, and a little salt; milk sufficient to make a dough;
roll out very thin, and bake. These cakes can be
fried in lard, in round cakes, and are then called
snow-balls.</p>

<h3>MARYLAND BISCUIT.</h3>

<p>Cut up a quarter of a pound of lard and butter,
into two pounds of flour; add a little salt and water
enough to make a stiff dough; beat very light with
an axe, till it will break off short: stick with a fork,
and bake in a quick oven. To be made up in small
cakes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<h3>BUCKWHEAT CAKES.</h3>

<p>In a quart of buckwheat meal, put a cup of Indian
or wheat flour, whichever is preferred. Make
this into a batter, with water, a little warm, a cup
of yeast and a little salt. Set it to rise, and when
quite light, pour it on the griddle. It is better to
set them to rise in a pitcher, as stirring the batter
spoils them.</p>

<h3>FLANNEL CAKES.</h3>

<p>Make a batter of a pint of milk, sufficiently warm
to melt in it a piece of butter the size of an egg,
two eggs, a little salt and flour; put in a cup of yeast,
and set it to rise three hours: bake on the griddle.
If you wish them quick, make them of soda and
cream of tartar, one third soda, and two thirds cream
of tartar, or yeast powder.</p>

<h3>SALLY LUNN.</h3>

<p>Take a pint of milk and water mixed; warm it,
and melt a small piece of butter in it. Put in flour
enough to make a stiff batter. Two eggs and a
cup of good yeast, a little salt, but no sugar. Set
it in a warm place to rise. Send to table whole. This
quantity will take near an hour to bake: do not beat
it after the yeast goes in.</p>

<h3>POTATO BREAD OR ROLLS.</h3>

<p>Take some mealy potatoes, mash them fine in some
flour, a small piece of butter, a little salt and some
yeast; when light, roll out in cakes: put them in pans,
and set them away to rise, and when light, bake.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<h3>MUSH MUFFINS.</h3>

<p>Take a pint of corn mush, and when milk warm,
put in a lump of butter, a little milk, two eggs, and

the size of an egg; pour upon this a quart of boiling
milk; add a little salt and two eggs well beaten;
when cool, a tea-cup full of yeast and flour, enough to
make a stiff batter: when light, bake in rings.</p>

<h3>QUICK MUFFINS.</h3>

<p>One and a half pints of milk to a quart of flour,

quart of sour cream add flour enough to make a
batter, two eggs well beaten, a small piece of butter,
and one teaspoonful of soda; just before baking, a
little salt; bake immediately: a little boiled rice will
be a great improvement.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<h3>REMARKS ON MAKING INDIAN BREAD.</h3>

<p>It is better in making Indian bread to pour the
liquid, either water or milk, boiling hot on the Indian
meal. Indian takes more salt than wheat.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE MUSH.</h3>

<p>Have a pot of boiling water. Stir in gradually
corn meal to make it thick. Salt it to your taste:
let it boil one hour. When it is cold, slice it and
fry it a light brown: send to table hot.</p>

<h3>CORN BATTER CAKES.</h3>

<p>Pour boiling milk on meal, enough to make a batter;
add a little salt and two eggs. The eggs will prevent
them breaking when they are turned: send hot
to table. If this batter is made thick and baked in
a pan, it is called pone.</p>

<h3>JOURNEY CAKE.</h3>

<p>Mix well some corn meal with water, and a little
salt. Have ready the middle board of a flour barrel-head;
wet the board, upon which put the dough
with a large spoon; smooth it over; bake before the
fire; when baked brown, turn the other side. Send
hot to table.</p>

<h3>LIGHTENED PONE.</h3>

<p>Pour either milk or water boiling hot on a pint of
corn meal; add salt, and, when it is cool, some yeast
and two eggs; when it is light, it will open at top:
bake in pans an inch thick.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<h3>INDIAN BREAKFAST CAKES.</h3>

<p>Upon one quart of corn meal, pour one quart of
boiling milk, with a small piece of butter, a spoonful
of salt, a spoonful of cream of tartar, and a half
one of soda sifted with the meal; when well mixed
drop them into a pan, and bake in an oven: these
cakes must be rough on top.</p>

<h3>POTATO CAKES.</h3>

<p>Boil ten mealy potatoes, put to them a piece of
butter the size of an egg, some salt and flour, enough
to roll them out; bake them in cakes, on the griddle:
send hot to table.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE PUFF PASTE.</h3>

<p>Take one pound and a half of flour; sift half of it
into a tin pan. The remainder keep for rolling out
the paste; take a pound of butter which has been
washed and well worked the night before, and kept
in a cold place. Cut up half of it with two knives
into the flour, then mix it with a tumbler of ice
water. Then roll it out very thin, and spread on
it in small thin pieces a quarter of a pound of butter,
and sift flour over it. Cut it in strips, about four
inches wide, and six long; lay one upon another till
they are all on; then roll again, and put the remaining
quarter of butter on as before; roll and cut it
in strips, and those strips in squares, and lay one upon
another. When you make the pie do not take one of
the strips, but cut it down, so as to have as many
layers as possible in each pie. Always use the
knives: never touch the paste with the hand.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<h3>ANOTHER VERY SUPERIOR PUFF PASTE.</h3>

<p>One pound and a quarter of flour, and one of
butter. The butter should be divided into four parts,
and the salt well washed out of it in three different
waters, the night before, and set in a cold place to
become hard, the harder the better. Weigh a pound
and a quarter of flour; sift half a pound of the flour
into a tin pan, (such a pan as should be always kept
for making pastry,) keep the rest of the flour in the
sieve. Cut up in the pan with the half pound of
flour, a quarter of a pound of butter with two knives.
(The hands should never touch the pastry.) Then
pour slowly into the pan half a pint of ice water;
mixing it with the knives. Sift some of the flour
on your board, and roll it out very thin, with a
floured rolling pin; sufficient flour must be used to
prevent it sticking to the board; put over the
paste in small pieces as regularly as possible, one
quarter of butter; then sift flour over and cut it in
strips about three inches wide; then cut across as
many times, placing one piece upon another till it
makes quite a high mound. Flour it and roll it out
again as thin as possible. Then put on in very
small pieces the third quarter of butter, and proceed
as above, with the last quarter; roll out very thin,
cutting it as before. The flour is now all rolled in
except half of a pound, reserved for rolling out the
paste when making up. It should be made in a cold
place, and near an open window. When you make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
up your pies cut a piece from top to bottom of the
pile, and roll out thin. The fire should be under
pastry to make it puff up. There is nothing better
for baking pastry than a ten plate stove.</p>

<h3>VERY SUPERIOR MINCE PIES.</h3>

<p>Take a fresh tongue and some of the neck, four
pounds in all; two pounds of suet, four pounds of
raisins, two of currants, two of citron, six pounds of

half a peck of apples. Cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves,
and very little salt.</p>

<h3>CURRANT PIES.</h3>

<p>Pick and scald your currants; let them stand a few
minutes, then pour off the water. Some prefer them
stewed. Sugar to your taste. Gooseberries are
prepared in the same way.</p>

<h3>RHUBARB PIE.</h3>

<p>Take off the skin; cut in small pieces; sugar them
and put them in the paste, and bake. Some prefer
them stewed.</p>

<h3>BLACKBERRY PIE.</h3>

<p>Wash your blackberries; put them in the paste,
with sugar to your taste: bake, and send hot to
table. These pies are not good, if they stand long
after being baked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>Pour one quart of boiling milk over a half pint
of corn meal; add two tablespoonsful of butter, and
four of molasses; beat four eggs very light; and, when
perfectly cool, add them, with a glass of brandy,
and mace and nutmeg: bake, and send to table hot
with wine sauce.</p>

<h3>RICE PUDDING.</h3>

<p>Take half a pint of rice; wash it well; put it on
to boil with very little water, and let it boil dry;
then stir in a piece of butter the size of a goose egg;
a grated nutmeg, a tea-cup full of loaf sugar, a quart
of milk, and two eggs well beaten: pour it into a
pudding dish, and bake.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<h3>COCOANUT PUDDING.</h3>

<p>Grate one cocoanut; pour the milk on some sugar,
then boil it, and throw in the cocoanut; let it come
to a boil again. When cold, add four eggs well
beaten: bake in puff paste.</p>

<h3>BREAD PUDDING.</h3>

<p>Take the inside of a stale loaf of baker’s bread;
pour over it one quart of boiling milk; when perfectly
cold, add five eggs well beaten, one cup full of
sugar, a small piece of butter, a little brandy, mace,
and nutmeg: bake in buttered pans. A few raisins
would be an improvement.</p>

<h3>POOR MAN’S PUDDING.</h3>

a few moments; then take it off. Beat four eggs very
light; add sugar and rose water, to your taste: bake
in a crust, or in a buttered dish.</p>

<h3>TAPIOCA PUDDING.</h3>

<p>Wash well the tapioca; one cup to a quart of milk;
put it on the stove; let it boil till soft; stir in while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
hot a little butter; let it get cold; beat three eggs
very light: season to your taste, with sugar and

water off; then add more water and some green ginger;
let this boil till the water tastes of the ginger
very strong: allow three quarters of a pound of
sugar to a quart of juice; make a syrup and put in
the tomatoes; let them boil till clear. The syrup,
when boiled down, will make a nice jelly.

<h3>TO PRESERVE CITRON MELON.</h3>

<p>Pare the melon, and cut it in any shape you fancy;

it has boiled ten minutes take it up; make a syrup,
allowing a pound of sugar to a quart of the water;
add slices of lemon; cut them; put in your citron:
when clear, it is done.</p>

<h3>SPICED PEACHES.</h3>

sugar, and one pint of vinegar; make a syrup; then
put in the fruit. Soft free-stone peaches are the
best; let them boil ten minutes.</p>

<h3>PLUMS.</h3>

<p>Plums are prepared in the same way as peaches,
also cantelopes before they are ripe; add cloves,
mace and allspice, to the taste: make the syrup;
put in the plums, and let boil ten minutes; or pour
the boiling vinegar and spices over the plums.</p>

<h3>BLACKBERRY FLUMMERY.</h3>

are soft; then strain them through a flannel bag or a
hair sieve; press all the juice out; allow a pound of
the best loaf sugar to a pint of the juice; boil twenty
minutes, not longer. Another way is to pour the
boiling juice on the sugar: this makes much prettier
jelly, but not so rich.</p>

<h3>APPLE JELLY.</h3>

<p>Cut up some fine pippin apples; do not pare
them; let them boil till quite tender: then strain
the juice and put it down with sugar, allowing

done, which will be as soon as it is thick, take out
the lemon peel. Put the jelly in half-pint tumblers.</p>

it jellies.</p>

<h3>MORELLA CHERRIES OR CARNATION.</h3>

<p>Allow one pound of sugar to a pound of cherries;

<h3>STRAWBERRY JAM.</h3>

<p>Strawberry jam is made in the same manner as
raspberry jam.</p>

<h3>PINE APPLES.</h3>

<p>Grate them; allow a pound of sugar to a pint of
the fruit; after it has been grated, half an hour
will cook it sufficiently.</p>

the syrup boils, put in the plums. Have a slow
fire, and let them boil till they are clear; take out
the plums, and spread them on dishes to cool; put
the syrup in a tureen, and set all away till perfectly
cold. Then put some of the plums in half pint
tumblers, nearly filling them full of the syrup, which
will be very rich; pour on the top of each tumbler
a dessert spoonful of good brandy. Cut a round
piece of white paper the size of the top of the tumbler;
soak it in brandy, and lay it on top; then
cover it tight by pasting paper over. Preserves
properly done and put up in this way will be as
good at the end of three years as the first. Glass
tumblers are excellent for putting up jelly and preserves.
Prune plums, egg plums, and the common
blue plums may all be done in the same way.</p>

<h3>WATER MELON RINDS.</h3>

<p>The rinds are cut in various fancy forms; make

and put them in the kettle with cabbage leaves
over and under them and between every layer; put
the kettle on the fire; do not let them come to a
boil, but keep them scalding over two hours; when
they are green, put them in cold water for three
days; change the water several times. Some persons
make two syrups; but one will be sufficient, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
making a syrup of a pound and a quarter of sugar
to one of melon; drop in some ginger; boil twenty-five
minutes.</p>

of half a pound of sugar to one of fruit; put the
peaches in and let them scald; then take them out,
put them on a flat dish, and set the syrup away;
next day repeat the process; then put them in the
oven, after the bread comes out, on a flat dish; do
this till they are dry; pack them in jars, sprinkling
sugar over each layer. The syrup will make cordial.</p>

and scald them till all of the salt is out; make a
syrup with three quarters of a pound of sugar to a
pound of limes; skim it, and put in the fruit; let
them boil till clear. It is better to boil the limes in
water for twenty minutes before they go in the syrup.</p>

then take them up, and put them away; in
two weeks they will be fit for use; at the end of
that time boil the vinegar again, and pour over
them.</p>

<h3>PICCALILLE.</h3>

<p>Piccalille is made in the same manner, only the
vinegar must be cold when it is poured on: omit

<h2 class="antiqua">Soup.</h2>

<h3>CALF’S HEAD SOUP.</h3>

<p>Take a calf’s head; wash and soak it for one hour.
Then put it down early in the morning with four
quarts of water to boil. When you can separate
the meat from the bones easily, take it up. Be careful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
to take out all the bones, and chop the meat
very fine. Then put on your soup to boil again,
with two onions, a bunch of parsley and thyme, seasoned
with pepper and salt, with a little flour made
very smooth in water, allspice, cloves, and mace.
Have ready a small piece of butter boiling hot, into
which put white sugar and half a tumbler full of claret
wine; put this in a pitcher; add as much of this as
you wish; when you first put on the soup (the quantity
will depend upon the colour you wish the soup,)
boil three eggs hard; take the yolks and one of the
whites, mash them up fine with a little flour; fry
them a light brown. Keep the pan moving all the
time. Before you put on the head take out the
brains; boil them for a few minutes. Then chop
them up, and put them in with the eggs and half a
tumbler full of Madeira wine, just before you dish the
soup. A little mushroom catsup will improve this soup
very much. Beef soup made in this way is very good.</p>

<h3>CALF’S HEAD SOUP ANOTHER WAY.</h3>

<p>After cleaning it well, put it down to boil with
one gallon of water. When it is half done, take up
the meat; cut it up in small pieces, carefully removing
all the bones. Put the meat in the soup
with a quart of beef stock: season with black and
cayenne pepper and salt. Fry two onions; cut in
thin slices, in butter, and stir in a little flour to
thicken the gravy; put this in the soup. About ten
minutes before serving it up, put in some chives and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
parsley chopped fine, with egg balls made as in the
above receipt, with two spoonsful of mushroom catsup
and one of soy, and a pint of white wine. Squeeze
a lemon in the tureen, and pour the soup upon it.
This is very good.</p>

<h3>CALF’S HEAD SOUP ANOTHER WAY.</h3>

<p>Take a large calf’s head, wash it very clean, and
let it boil an hour and a half. Then take it up, removing
all the meat from the bones; skim the soup
well; add two quarts of veal stock, and put in the
meat after cutting it in small square pieces; add
three large onions, half an ounce of cloves, and nutmeg
and mace; chop very fine all kinds of sweet
herbs. Strain off the liquor. Put a quarter of a
pound of butter in a pan on the fire, and when it is
hot, stir in some flour and a little sugar. Put this
in the soup, stirring it well: season it to your taste:
add eggs, balls fried, and a pint of wine. Serve it
up hot.</p>

<h3>TURTLE SOUP.</h3>

<p>In most of the markets the turtle can be bought
cleaned and ready for cooking. If not, place it on
its back to make it extend itself. Then cut off its
head and fins; let it bleed freely; when quite dead,
cut the belly part clean off, take out the gall and
the sand bag. Draw and wash the entrails well.
Scald the black meat, so that the skin will come off,
which must be done very carefully. Cut the meat
in joints like a chicken, then put it down with five
quarts of water. Let it boil till soft, (which will depend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
upon the turtle; if it is old, it will take a long
time.) Make forcemeat balls of one pound and a half
of veal, chopped fine, with parsley, thyme, pepper,
salt, and two eggs and flour to thicken; fry them in
butter and lard; put half a pound of butter in the
pan, and when hot, stir in enough flour to thicken
it. Put these all in the soup, and season with pepper,
cayenne and black, with salt to your taste; let
it simmer, till the flour is well cooked: put in just as
you dish it up, one quart of Madeira wine. This
is very superior.</p>

<h3>EGG SOUP.</h3>

<p>Boil a small piece of beef or the scrag end of the
neck of veal: season it with pepper and salt, and
let it boil very gently till the meat is well cooked.
Then strain it. Beat the yolks of two eggs well,
with some chopped parsley, and pour the soup in the
tureen on the eggs. Keep stirring it all the time.
A little rice will improve this soup very much:
put the soup in the boiler again, after it is strained,
and cook till done.</p>

<h3>CLAM SOUP.</h3>

<p>Take two quarts of clams. After they are opened,
cut off the beards and put them down to cook, with
equal quantities of the water and the liquor. Take
four crackers pounded fine and rolled in butter; stir
in very gently: season with pepper, salt, chopped
parsley, a little mace, and add a pint of sweet cream,
just before you take it up.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<h3>OYSTER SOUP.</h3>

<p>Oyster soup is made as clam soup, only omitting
parsley and substituting a little mace.</p>

<h3>SOUP FOR THE SICK.</h3>

<p>In a pint of boiling water put half a wine-glass full
of wine; beat up the yolk of one egg; when the
water and wine boils, pour it out into a bowl; then
on the egg; continue to pour it from one bowl to
another, two or three times; then add a small piece
of butter, a little sugar and nutmeg.</p>

<h3>TERRAPINS.</h3>

<p>Take the terrapins one at a time, and immerse
them in boiling water for half a minute; take them
out and remove the skin; put them back into hot
water, and watch them carefully that they do not
boil too much; (some will be done in half an
hour, others will take much longer. They are sufficiently
done when the feet are soft to the touch.)
Take off the shell and remove the sand bag and the
gall, (which will be found in the liver; the sand
bag is full of water;) then put them down to stew
with one pound of best butter to three good-sized
terrapins: season with red and a little black pepper;
(no salt;) when they are perfectly heated
through, put in the following dressing, and when it
boils furnish the seasoning with a little salt, &amp;c., if
required. Dressing,&mdash;Take three yolks of hard-boiled
eggs, to one large terrapin; mash them up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
fine, and add the best Madeira, a little at a time,
until you make a thin paste; stir this into the terrapins,
and add more wine, if necessary. There
should be just dressing enough to float near to the
top of your terrapin in the saucepan.</p>

<h3>ROMAN PUNCH.</h3>

<p>One gallon of water, one quart of cream, the
juice of a dozen lemons, one pint of the best brandy,

<p>Half boil some veal; then cut it in small pieces;
season it with cayenne pepper, salt, nutmeg, parsley
and a little butter: make a good paste; line the
sides of a deep dish; put in the meat, and add some
cream; have a small cup in the middle of the pie;
cut across the centre, and turn back the sides to
let the steam escape: bake slowly.</p>

<h3>GUINEA FOWL.</h3>

<p>They are very good cooked as pheasants or
stewed like chickens.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<h3>SUCCOTASH.</h3>

<p>Boil some string beans in as little water as they
can be cooked in, with salt; when nearly done, have
some corn cut from the ears put in, and season
with pepper, salt, butter and a little cream; twenty
minutes will be long enough for the corn to cook;
but the beans will require an hour and a half. In
winter, succotash can be made with dried corn and
beans; let them both soak all night in the water you
boil them in, after washing them well.</p>

<h3>POTTED SHAD.</h3>

<p>Take fine large shad, and when they are thoroughly
cleaned and washed, <i>split</i> them in two and
cut them in square pieces. Place a layer of fish
in a stone crock; (a glazed one will not answer;)
sprinkle over it salt, cloves, whole pepper and mace;
thus continue till your crock is filled; pour over it
the best pure cider vinegar; cover the mouth of the
crock with a bladder, which should be tied down sufficiently
tight, to prevent the steam from escaping;
place it in a moderately warm oven, and let it bake
for several hours. It is a good plan to send it to
a bake-house, and let it be put in a brick oven,
after the bread is taken out. If properly done, the
bones will all be dissolved, and it will be almost equal
to salmon.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE STOCK FOR SOUPS AND GRAVY.</h3>

<p>To one shin of beef and one of veal, add eight
quarts of water, and salt to the taste; skim it well,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
and let it boil till it is quite thick: take out all the
meat, and pour off the stock; set it away till next
day: you can add some of this to your soup, and it
will improve it very much. Geese, ducks, and
chickens are very good stewed in stock made after
the above receipt, and then browned in an oven.</p>

<h3>TO STEW SWEET-BREADS.</h3>

<p>Parboil them; then cut in small pieces; season

wine.</p>

<p>Cut in small pieces; have two onions fried brown;
put it down in a little good gravy; just before you
dish it, season with pepper, salt, a little currant
jelly and wine, or a spoonful of walnut pickle.</p>

<h3>SUGAR DROPS.</h3>

beat the eggs separately very light; then mix
them together, and add the dissolved sugar, beating
it in the egg very hard; lastly, stir in the flour
very <i>slowly</i>.</p>

<h3>PIGNOLATTIS.</h3>

<p>One pound of sugar, three quarters of a pound
of flour, five eggs, five ounces of almonds or ground-nuts,

together; flavour with grated lemon peel, and bake
in a moderate oven.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<h3>APPLES IN JELLY.</h3>

<p>Have some moderate-sized cooking apples; pare
and core without cutting them open. Let them
boil slowly till they are tender, with some slices of
lemon; when they are done, take them up, and
add sugar enough to the liquor to make a syrup;
put the apples in, and let them boil till clear; put
in half an ounce of isinglass dissolved; lay a slice
of lemon on each apple, and pour the jelly around
them.</p>

<h3>SYLLABUB.</h3>

<p>Take the juice and peel of one large lemon, two
glasses of wine, and one of brandy; sugar to the
taste; to this add a pint of whipped cream; arrange
it in glasses.</p>

<h3>A DISH OF SNOW.</h3>

<p>Grate the white part of the cocoa-nut, and pile it
up in the middle; this is nice to eat with preserves
or fruit, and is a delicate relish for tea.</p>

<p>To two bowls of cottage cheese, add ten eggs, and
half a pint of cream, mace, cinnamon, sugar, and
nutmeg, to the taste; add a little brandy; bake in

add ten eggs, beaten very light, and sugar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
to the taste; a glass of brandy, and some lemon peel;
bake in puff paste. You may take equal quantities
of almonds and cocoa-nut.</p>

<p>Take out all the inside, and lay them in salt and
water for two days; then wash them well; put them
in fresh water; let them boil till tender; then take
them up; throw off the water; and make a syrup
with half their weight of sugar; put in the peel for
twenty minutes; then take them up; and when the
syrup is thick, pour over the peel; put them in jars,
and cover tightly. This may be used as citron.</p>

<h3>TO COOK CHEESE AND EGGS.</h3>

<p>To half a pound of grated cheese, add the yolks
of six eggs, and half a pound of butter; stir all together;
add some cayenne pepper, and bake.</p>

<h3>TO PICKLE CUCUMBERS.</h3>

<p>Scald the cucumbers in brine; let them stand till
cold; repeat this three times; then put them in jars,
pouring on vinegar, with a small quantity of whisky
in each jar; let them stand for three months; they
will be hard and green.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE MOLASSES CANDY.</h3>

<p>Grease the saucepan with butter; then put in
the molasses, with a little brown sugar; let it boil
for half an hour, stirring it all the while; when it is
brittle, it is done. If you like, add the kernels of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
any kind of nuts you prefer: just before taking up,
pour into buttered tin pans, and set away to cool.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE CANDY WITH THE KERNELS OF NUTS.</h3>

<p>Make a thick syrup; then throw in the kernels of
any kind of nuts you prefer; have buttered tin pans,
and pour it out.</p>

<h3>JELLY.</h3>

<p>Three quarts of water, four of gelatine, three
pounds of sugar, the whites of five eggs, one pint of
wine, and six tablespoonsful of brandy, and six
lemons, peel and juice. The gelatine must be soaked
in one quart of water for half an hour; stir all the
ingredients, except the brandy, well together, before
it is put on the fire; first beating the white very
light. Let it boil ten minutes without disturbing it;
then strain it through a jelly strainer.</p>

<h3>CARRAGEEN, OR IRISH MOSS JELLY FOR THE SICK.</h3>

<p>One ounce of moss, one quart of water, three
tablespoonsful of sugar, half a pint of wine; boil
ten minutes, and strain.</p>

<h3>OINTMENT FOR MORTIFICATION.</h3>

<p>Make a salve of raw carrots; grate and stew them
in lard; when done, strain it. Another salve can
be made of the leaves and bark of black alder, stewed
in lard. Raw cranberries, cut in half and mashed,
are an excellent application.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<h3>ELDER-BERRY JAM.</h3>

<p>Put two quarts of elder-berries in a kettle, with
some water, say a pint; stir and mash them well;
when the juice is all extracted, strain it, and add
two pounds of the best loaf sugar; let this simmer
twenty minutes. This is good for colds, and sore
throat, and is a great purifier of the blood.</p>

<h3>BLACK CURRANT JELLY.</h3>

<p>Mash your currants well, and strain them through
a sieve; to one pint of juice, put one pound of loaf
sugar; boil twenty minutes. Quince jelly is also
very good for the throat. The seeds should always
be kept, as they are very good for sore mouth or
throat.</p>

<h3>TO PRESERVE ORANGE PEEL.</h3>

<p>Take out all the inside; then let them soak in salt
and water twenty-four hours; take them out; wash
them well, and let them boil for ten minutes; throw
off the water; make a rich syrup; after boiling the
peel till they are tender, put them in the syrup; let
them boil for ten minutes; and when the syrup is
thick, pour it over the peel.</p>

<h3>SCOTCH CAKE.</h3>

<p>Beat to a cream one pound of sugar, and three
quarters of a pound of butter; beat separately nine
eggs; put them into the cake; add the juice and
grated rind of a lemon, and a wine-glass full of brandy;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
then add one pound of sifted flour; and just before
it is put in the pans, a pound of seeded raisins.</p>

<h3>HARD GINGER BREAD.</h3>

<p>One quart of molasses, one pound of brown sugar,
three quarters of a pound of butter, cloves, and
ginger, to the taste; with very little cayenne pepper;
flour enough to roll it out. The cake must be very
thin, and bake in a slow oven.</p>

<h3>GINGER JUMBLES.</h3>

<p>One cup full of butter, two cups full of sugar, and
one cup full of molasses, one of cream, and a teaspoonful
of soda; dissolve in a small quantity of thick
milk a tablespoonful of ginger, two eggs, a glass
of wine, and flour sufficient to roll out thin.</p>

<h3>SPICE NUTS.</h3>

<p>Two pounds of butter, and the same of flour, one
quarter of a pound of ginger, an ounce of cake seed,
the same of cloves, and cinnamon, one quart of molasses,
three quarters of a pound of sugar, and nutmeg;
roll out thin, and bake.</p>

<h3>QUAKER CAKE.</h3>

<p>Three cups full of sugar, one cup full of butter,
six eggs, five cups full of flour, one teaspoonful of
soda; season with lemons or almonds to the taste.</p>

<h3>A. P. S.</h3>

<p>Cut fine half a pound of butter, in three quarters
of flour, half a pound of sugar, a glass of wine and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
brandy, rose water, and spice to your taste; then
mix in two ounces of flour, reserving two ounces to
mould them in.</p>

<h3>DOVER CAKE.</h3>

<p>Take one pound of sugar, half a pound of butter,
six eggs, one teaspoonful of soda, one cup full of sour
milk, one pound of flour; season to the taste.</p>

<h2 class="antiqua">Articles of Diet for the Sick.</h2>

<p>Here we may observe that neatness in serving up, as well as care and
cleanliness in the preparation, makes food for the sick room more
likely to be attractive to the fastidious appetite of the invalid.</p>

<h3>BARLEY WATER.</h3>

<p>Wash well a tea-cup full of pearl barley; put it
in a sauce pan, with two quarts of water, and a small
cup full of raisins; boil it to a quart; then strain,
and add sugar, nutmeg, and lemon juice, to your
taste.</p>

<h3>OATMEAL GRUEL.</h3>

<p>Mix smoothly a dessert spoonful of meal, with
two of cold water; pour on a pint of boiling water,
and let it boil for fifteen minutes, stirring all the
time; sugar or salt may be added as preferred. Wine
is sometimes used.</p>

<h3>CORN MEAL GRUEL.</h3>

<p>Wash several times in cold water, three tablespoonsful
of corn meal; pouring off the water as it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
settles; then pour on a quart of water, and boil,
stirring all the time; add a little salt; strain and
sweeten, adding butter, wine, and nutmeg.</p>

<h3>ARROW ROOT.</h3>

<p>Mix a dessert spoonful of arrow root smoothly,
in a little cold water; pour on it a pint of boiling
water; let it boil five minutes; then sweeten to your
taste, and add nutmeg and wine. If richer food is
required, this can be made in the same way, with
milk instead of water.</p>

<h3>WINE WHEY.</h3>

<p>To half a pint of boiling milk, add one glass full of
sherry wine, and a little sugar; let it boil until the
curd has separated, and strain through a fine sieve.</p>

<h3>RICE GRUEL.</h3>

<p>Stir into a pint of boiling water, a tablespoonful
of rice flour, which has been mixed with a little
water; let it boil fifteen minutes, stirring all the
time; then season with sugar and nutmeg, or a little
cream.</p>

<h3>TAMARIND WATER.</h3>

<p>Upon a gill of good tamarinds, pour a pint of
boiling water; cover it, and let it stand until cold,
with a lump of ice: it is very grateful to a feverish
person. Both currant and quince jelly make pleasant
drinks, prepared in the same way.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<h3>CREAM OF TARTAR PUNCH.</h3>

<p>Pour on a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, a tumbler
full of boiling water; sweeten to your taste, with
loaf sugar, and drink as hot as possible, upon getting
into bed; a teaspoonful of nitre in it is excellent
for a fever, or a cold.</p>

<h3>LEMONADE.</h3>

<p>Squeeze and strain the juice of six lemons into
three pints of ice water; sweeten to your taste: by
adding a gill of good French brandy, it will be
lemon punch. Some persons prefer it made with
boiling water, and then cooled with ice.</p>

<h3>VEGETABLE SOUP.</h3>

<p>Slice one potato, one turnip, one onion, one carrot,
and a little celery; boil in a quart of water one
hour; toast some bread nicely; cut in small pieces,
and lay in a bowl: add salt to the soup, and pour
over the toast.</p>

<h3>TOAST WATER.</h3>

<p>Let the water be boiled and cooled; then toast
bread of a deep brown, and pour over it the water;
let it stand half an hour. A small piece of dried
lemon or orange peel gives it a pleasant taste.</p>

<h3>SAGO.</h3>

<p>Sago should be well washed; put a tablespoonful
in a pint of milk, and boil it until it is quite soft;
sweeten to the taste, and add wine or lemon juice.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
Tapioca is made in the same way, but does not require
so much washing.</p>

<h3>CARRAGEEN MOSS.</h3>

<p>Pour upon one ounce of carrageen (after it has
been well washed) one quart of warm water; cover
it, and let it stand on top of a stove all night: it
will form a tasteless jelly, which when sweetened
and seasoned with lemon, is palatable and strengthening.</p>

<h3>CRACKER JELLY.</h3>

<p>Take a quarter of a pound of crackers; pour on
them two quarts of water; boil down to one quart;
strain it: add one pound of sugar, one pint of Madeira
wine, and a little nutmeg.</p>

<h3>BEEF TEA.</h3>

<p>Take a tender, juicy piece of beef; cut into small
pieces; put into a bottle with a little salt, and a
tablespoonful of water: place the bottle in a pan of
hot water, and let it boil three quarters of an hour.</p>

<h3>BEEF TEA.</h3>

<p>Cut up into small pieces a pound of juicy beef;
cover it with a quart of water, and let it stand for
two hours: then boil it until it is reduced to a pint;
let it cool: skim off all the grease; then boil again;
drink it while warm.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<h3>BALM TEA.</h3>

<p>Pour upon a tea-cup full of the leaves of dried
balm, a pint of boiling water; let it stand fifteen
minutes, when it is ready for use.</p>

<h3>CHICKEN TEA.</h3>

<p>Wash in cold water the leg and wing of a young
chicken; put it in a stew pan, with a pint of water
and a little salt; cover it, and let it boil twenty minutes;
then skim and strain it.</p>

<h3>MILK TOAST.</h3>

<p>Cut a thin slice from a loaf of stale baker’s bread;
toast it a light brown. Boil half a pint of milk,
and a small piece of butter ten minutes; then sprinkle
in a little salt, and pour over the toast. Cream
toast is made in the same way.</p>

<h3>TO KEEP FLOWERS FOR A LONG TIME.</h3>

<p>To one quart of water, add one teaspoonful of
carbonate of soda: do not change the water.</p>

<h3>TO KEEP FURS FROM MOTHS.</h3>

<p>Get the gum camphor; as soon as you can do
without the furs, beat them, and put small pieces
of camphor rolled in paper, in, and around them;
sew them up tightly in linen, and keep in a cool
place. Black pepper will not prevent the moths
getting in, nor will it kill them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<h3>TO WASH FLANNELS.</h3>

<p>Wash them in clean suds as hot as you can bear
the hands in; then in water of the same temperature,
with a little soap in, but not so much as the
first; rinse in hot water, and hang up immediately.</p>

<h3>TO WASH WINDOWS.</h3>

<p>Never put soap on the windows, but wash them
off with a shammy, and then dry them with the
same; if the shammy cannot be obtained, paper will
answer, but it is not so good.</p>

<h3>TO WASH BOTTLES BELONGING TO THE CASTOR.</h3>

<p>Wash them well with water, with a little soap
and soda in it, also some clean coarse sand or rice
to get the marks out.</p>

<h3>TO WASH CALICOES.</h3>

<p>Wash out the grease spots before putting the
dress in, as the spots cannot be seen after it is wet;
wash them well through two suds; then rinse them,
throwing a little salt in the water to set the colours;
starch and hang them in the shade, as the sun will
fade them. If the calico is black, make the starch
water as blue as possible. Wash, and hang up
quickly.</p>

<h3>TO GATHER GARDEN HERBS.</h3>

<p>Herbs should be gathered on a dry day, just before
they blossom. Wash them and hang them in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
a dry place; as soon as they are dry, put them in a
paper bag. Sage, sweet marjoram, summer savoury,
and thyme should be pounded fine, and kept in bottles
corked tight. When parsley is dry, cut it fine,
and keep in bottles.</p>

<h3>FOR A COUGH.</h3>

<p>Make a strong tea of hoarhound; then strain it,
and add half a pound of the best loaf sugar, to a
pint of the tea: let it simmer till thick; then bottle
it, and take a little two or three times a day.</p>

<h3>FOR A SORE THROAT OR MOUTH.</h3>

<p>Make a sage tea by boiling some sage leaves;
when strong, add honey and some alum or borax.
Gargle the throat with this often through the day.</p>

<h3>FOR THE STING OF A BEE OR WASP.</h3>

<p>Rub the part with hot tallow, or with hartshorn,
or wet clay.</p>

<h3>FOR POISON.</h3>

<p>Mix in a tumbler full of warm water one teaspoonful
of the flour of mustard; drink while warm: it will
make the patient throw off the poison. This is good
for the cramp.</p>

<h3>FOR BURNS.</h3>

<p>When the skin is not off, apply scraped raw potatoes.
When the skin is off, apply sweet oil and
cotton, or linseed oil and lime water made into a
paste. Elder ointment is very good: make the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
ointment of the green bark of the elder; stew in
lard.</p>

<p>Linseed oil and lime water mixed in a paste, is
also an excellent cure.</p>

<h3>TO PICK DUCKS AND GEESE.</h3>

<p>Dip them in boiling water; then wrap them for a
few moments in flannel, and pick them, holding
them by the feet, with the head down; be careful
to dry the feathers as soon as possible. A very
good way to cure feathers is to put them several
times in a brick oven after the bread comes out:
then let them lie on the ground for several days,
bringing them in at night. This will take away all
the disagreeable smell which is so unpleasant in
feathers when they are not properly dried.</p>

<h3>TO TAKE INK STAINS OUT OF LINEN.</h3>

<p>Rub the stain with lemon juice and salt, or a
little hot tallow; when the lemon juice and salt are
used, it must go in the sun for several hours; then
rinse it: new milk boiling hot will take out most
kinds of fruit stains; dip in them when dry, and
repeat it often.</p>

<h3>TO CLEAN CARPETS.</h3>

<p>Shake them well; then spread them on a clean
floor, and rub them with a soft brush dipped in camphine,
or with a piece of cloth: when they are dry,
if the grease is not out, repeat the operation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<h3>TO TAKE GREASE SPOTS OUT OF SILK OR WOOLLEN.</h3>

<p>Rub the spots with a sponge dipped in camphine;
rub, or if the article soiled be silk, spread magnesia
on the wrong side; let it remain for a day or two;
then brush it off, and the spot will have disappeared.</p>

<h3>TO CLEAN KNIVES AND FORKS.</h3>

<p>The iron filings from the blacksmith shop are excellent
to clean knives and forks with. Rotten
stone or fine brick dust is also very good. Do not
put the handles in hot water, as this injures them;
wipe them dry, and keep them rolled in brown
paper.</p>

<h3>TO CLEAN BRASS AND COPPER UTENSILS.</h3>

<p>All brass and copper utensils should be well
cleaned before using them, with hot vinegar and
salt, then washed in hot water; keep the vessel warm
till ready for use; when done with it, clean it well,
and keep in a dry place.</p>

<h3>TO CLEAN BRITANNIA.</h3>

<p>Rub them well with sweet oil and whitening;
when dry, rub them off with buckskin. If they are
well washed in hot soap suds, and rinsed in clean
hot water every day, and let dry quickly near the
fire or in the sun, they will seldom require rubbing.</p>

<h3>TO CLEAN STOVES.</h3>

<p>Mix some British lustre with alum water; put it
on with a brush, and with a dry brush rub it off.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<h3>TO PRESERVE CORN FOR WINTER USE.</h3>

<p>Take off all the outside husks; fasten the inside
ones down tight, and pack in barrels or boxes with
salt in alternate layers; keep in a cool place, or the
corn will heat and spoil.</p>

<h3>TO PRESERVE GRAPES.</h3>

<p>Gather the bunches on a dry day; be careful
that the grapes are all sound; pack them in sawdust
or cotton: put them in a box; fasten it up, and
keep in a dry place.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
